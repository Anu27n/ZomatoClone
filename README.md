# Zomato Frontend Clone

## Overview

This project is a frontend clone of the popular food delivery and restaurant discovery platform, **Zomato**. The clone was created using only **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on replicating the design, layout, and overall look and feel of the Zomato homepage. It includes various sections such as navigation, hero banners, restaurant listings, and footer.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Clean UI**: Mimics Zomato's original user interface, including the navbar, search bar, and restaurant cards.
- **Static Pages**: This is a static clone, meaning it focuses solely on the visual aspect without any backend functionality like user authentication or live data fetching.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works across different web browsers, ensuring a consistent experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and creating the layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including layout design, fonts, colors, and responsive features.
